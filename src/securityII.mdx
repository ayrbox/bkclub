# External Contract Referencing
Ethereum allow to refer to external contract and send exteranl message calls.
Meaning contracts can hide malicious code.
---
# Example - ROT13 
ROT-13
Rotate by 13
---
```
import "Rot13Encryption.sol";

// encrypt your top-secret info
contract EncryptionContract {
    // library for encryption
    Rot13Encryption encryptionLibrary;

    // constructor - initialize the library
    constructor(Rot13Encryption _encryptionLibrary) {
        encryptionLibrary = _encryptionLibrary;
    }

    function encryptPrivateData(string privateInfo) {
        // potentially do some operations here
        encryptionLibrary.rot13Encrypt(privateInfo);
     }
 }
```
--- 
Usage
```
contract Rot26Encryption {

   event Result(string convertedString);

    // rot13-encrypt a string
    function rot13Encrypt (string text) public {
        uint256 length = bytes(text).length;
        for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            byte char = bytes(text)[i];
            // inline assembly to modify the string
            assembly {
                // get the first byte
                char := byte(0,char)
                // if the character is in [n,z], i.e. wrapping
                if and(gt(char,0x6D), lt(char,0x7B))
                // subtract from the ASCII number 'a',
                // the difference between character <char> and 'z'
                { char:= sub(0x60, sub(0x7A,char)) }
                // ignore spaces
                if iszero(eq(char, 0x20))
                // add 26 to char!
                {mstore8(add(add(text,0x20), mul(i,1)), add(char,26))}
            }
        }
        emit Result(text);
    }

    // rot13-decrypt a string
    function rot13Decrypt (string text) public {
        uint256 length = bytes(text).length;
        for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            byte char = bytes(text)[i];
            assembly {
                char := byte(0,char)
                if and(gt(char,0x60), lt(char,0x6E))
                { char:= add(0x7B, sub(char,0x61)) }
                if iszero(eq(char, 0x20))
                {mstore8(add(add(text,0x20), mul(i,1)), sub(char,26))}
            }
        }
        emit Result(text);
    }
}

# Short Address/Parameter Attack

This attack is not performed on Solidity contracts themselves, but on third-party applications that may interact with them. This section is added for completeness and to give the reader an awareness of how parameters can be manipulated in contracts.

}
```

## Prevention
--- 
## Real-World Examples: GovernMental
GovernMental was an old Ponzi scheme that accumulated quite a large amount of ether (1,100 ether, at one point). Unfortunately, it was susceptible to the DoS vulnerabilities mentioned in this section.
---
# Block Timestamp Manipulation
Block timestamps have historically been used for a variety of applications, such as entropy for random numbers (see the Entropy Illusion for further details), locking funds for periods of time, and various state-changing conditional statements that are time-dependent. Miners have the ability to adjust timestamps slightly, which can prove to be dangerous if block timestamps are used incorrectly in smart contracts.
---
## Vulnerability
```
contract Roulette {
    uint public pastBlockTime; // forces one bet per block

    constructor() public payable {} // initially fund contract

    // fallback function used to make a bet
    function () public payable {
        require(msg.value == 10 ether); // must send 10 ether to play
        require(now != pastBlockTime); // only 1 transaction per block
        pastBlockTime = now;
        if(now % 15 == 0) { // winner
            msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
        }
    }
}
```
---
## Prevention
Block timestamps should not be used for entropy or generating random numbers—i.e., they should not be the deciding factor (either directly or through some derivation) for winning a game or changing an important state.
---
## Real-World Example: GovernMental

# Constructors with Care
Constructors are special functions that often perform critical, privileged tasks when initializing contracts. Before Solidity v0.4.22, constructors were defined as functions that had the same name as the contract that contained them. In such cases, when the contract name is changed in development, if the constructor name isn’t changed too it becomes a normal, callable function. As you can imagine, this can lead (and has) to some interesting contract hacks.
---
## Vulnerability

```
contract OwnerWallet {
    address public owner;

    // constructor
    function ownerWallet(address _owner) public {
        owner = _owner;
    }

    // Fallback. Collect ether.
    function () payable {}

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
    }
}
```
---
## Preventative Techniques
This issue has been addressed in version 0.4.22 of the Solidity compiler. This version introduced a constructor keyword that specifies the constructor, rather than requiring the name of the function to match the contract name. Using this keyword to specify constructors is recommended to prevent naming issues.
---
### Real-World Example: Rubixi

---
# Uninitialized Storage Pointers

---
## Vulnerability
```
// A locked name registrar
contract NameRegistrar {

    bool public unlocked = false;  // registrar locked, no name updates

    struct NameRecord { // map hashes to addresses
        bytes32 name;
        address mappedAddress;
    }

    // records who registered names
    mapping(address => NameRecord) public registeredNameRecord;
    // resolves hashes to addresses
    mapping(bytes32 => address) public resolve;

    function register(bytes32 _name, address _mappedAddress) public {
        // set up the new NameRecord
        NameRecord newRecord;
        newRecord.name = _name;
        newRecord.mappedAddress = _mappedAddress;

        resolve[_name] = _mappedAddress;
        registeredNameRecord[msg.sender] = newRecord;

        require(unlocked); // only allow registrations if contract is unlocked
    }
}

# Contract Libraries
- deployed on-chain as callable libraries and off-chain as code template libraries
- well-established existing on-platform libraries comes with many advantages
-- latest upgrades
-- saves you money
-- benefits the Ethereum ecosystem by reducing the total number of live contracts in Ethereum
---
# Most common contract libraries
- OpenZeppelin suite (ERC20 and ERC721 token)
- many flavors of crowdsale models, to simple behaviors commonly found in contracts, such as Ownable, Pausable, or LimitBalance
