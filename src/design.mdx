# MASTERING ETHEREUM

**Chapter 8**  
Smart Contracts and Vyper

*23 Jan 2019*

export default SideTitle

### Words of Week

### Pervasive *adj.*  
(in [Comparison to Solidity > Modifiers](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/08smart-contracts-vyper.asciidoc#modifiers))

- Present or noticeable in every part of a thing or place.
- (especially of an unwelcome influence or physical effect) spreading widely throughout an area or a group of people.

### Congruent *adj.* 
(in [Comparison to Solidity > Variable Typecasting](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/08smart-contracts-vyper.asciidoc#variable-typecasting))   
- Similar to or in agreement with something, so that the two things can both exist or can be combined without problems.

# Why Vyper
## Or the quest towards more secure code

> **Fun fact**  
> There are nearly one million   
> deployed Ethereum smart contracts.   
> That’s approximately one for seven blocks.

### Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts  
“One of the principles of Vyper is to make it virtually impossible for developers to write misleading code.”

### Suicidal Contracts  
<div>

Smart contracts that can be killed by arbitrary addresses.  

E.g. SELFDESTRUCT function can be called by anyone.

</div>

### Greedy Contracts

<div>

Smart contracts that can reach a state in which they cannot release ether.  

E.g. A library is removed, thus making its functions impossible to use.

</div>


### Prodigal Contracts
<div>

Smart contracts that can be made to release ether to arbitrary addresses.  

E.g. Bounty contracts that can be called by anybody and drained of their ether.

### Remove unsecure features
<div>

Rather than adding features, Vyper removes all high risk features that an imperative language like solidity has, in order to provide a secure and risk free coding environment.

Most of them were covered in the previous chapter, some of them weren’t.

</div>

<div />

- Modifiers
- Class inheritance
- Inline assembly
- Function overloading
- Variable typecasting
- Preconditions and Postconditions

### Decorators 
<div>

Four built-in explicit decorators:

- @private
- @public
- @constant
- @payable

</div>

## Function and Variable Ordering
<div> 

- Single file
- In a specific order

Allows for more readability and auditability.
Follows Python ordering requirements.

</div>

<div />

> Is this order just based on logic from the developer, or does it follow a specific patern built-in to Python?

### Own code and editor compiler

Compile your smart contracts into bytecode, ABI, and LLL using only your web browse

### Buit-in overflow protection

<div>

In Solidity, devs aren’t forced to use safety tools. Vyper has built-in overflow protection.

> […] Vyper uses clamps whenever a literal constant is loaded, a value is passed to a function, or a variable is assigned. Clamps are implemented via custom functions in the Low-level Lisp-like Language (LLL) compiler, and cannot be disabled. (The Vyper compiler outputs LLL rather than EVM bytecode; this simplifies the development of Vyper itself.) […]

# Give me some knowledge

<div>

Seams to me that when dealing with hi-risk assets such as cryptocurrencies, this type of language should be standard. However it is not.

- Why is this the case?
- What would you rather be using?
- After reading those two chapters, has your preference changed?
- Would the level of security given by Vyper make you switch? 
- If not for all projects, would there be any special cases when you would definitely use Vyper now (and vice-versa)?
