### Words of Week

### Pervasive *adj.*  
(in [Comparison to Solidity > Modifiers](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/08smart-contracts-vyper.asciidoc#modifiers))

- Present or noticeable in every part of a thing or place.
- (especially of an unwelcome influence or physical effect) spreading widely throughout an area or a group of people.

### Congruent *adj.* 
(in [Comparison to Solidity > Variable Typecasting](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/08smart-contracts-vyper.asciidoc#variable-typecasting))   
- Similar to or in agreement with something, so that the two things can both exist or can be combined without problems.

# Why Vyper
## Or the quest towards more secure code

> **Fun fact**  
> There are nearly one million   
> deployed Ethereum smart contracts.   
> That’s approximately one for seven blocks.

### Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts  
“One of the principles of Vyper is to make it virtually impossible for developers to write misleading code.”

### Suicidal Contracts  
<div>

Smart contracts that can be killed by arbitrary addresses.  

E.g. SELFDESTRUCT function can be called by anyone.

</div>

### Greedy Contracts

<div>

Smart contracts that can reach a state in which they cannot release ether.  

E.g. A library is removed, thus making its functions impossible to use.

</div>


### Prodigal Contracts
<div>

Smart contracts that can be made to release ether to arbitrary addresses.  

E.g. Bounty contracts that can be called by anybody and drained of their ether.

</div>
